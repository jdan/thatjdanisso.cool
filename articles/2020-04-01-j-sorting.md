Following my previous [(1)](/j-fibonacci) posts [(2)](/j-pascal) on a fun little language called J (http://jsoftware.com/), I thought I'd do a quick writeup for some source code I provided in the [Khan Academy Alumni](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/alumni) slack channel.

Over the next few paragraphs we're going to sort some strings by length, and end up with a function that is 5 characters in length: `\:#&>` (really!)

```
   (\:#&>) ;: 'sorting strings by length'
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇsorting‚îÇstrings‚îÇlength‚îÇby‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

## Boxes of strings

We can use the [`;: Words`](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/d332.htm) verb to get a list of words in a string.

```
   'a'; 'tall'; 'cat'
‚îå‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇa‚îÇtall‚îÇcat‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
   ;: 'a tall cat'
‚îå‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇa‚îÇtall‚îÇcat‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

The fancy characters around each word represent the fact that they are "boxed."

We can [`> Open`](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/d020.htm) boxes.

```
   > ;: 'a tall cat'
a
tall
cat
```

We can get the number of items in a list (or a string - which is a list of characters) using the [`# Tally`](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/d400.htm) verb.

```
   # 1 3 5
3
   # 'hello'
5
```

We can compose these two operations with [`& Bond`](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/d630n.htm) conjunction, which takes two verbs and returns a single verb.

```
   # & > ;: 'hello world'
5 5
   #&> ;: 'a tall cat'
1 4 3
```

Now we are able to get the number of characters in each string.

## Sorting and ranking

[`\: Sort Down`](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/d432.htm) is a powerful verb which sorts the left argument using the right argument for scoring (in descending order).

For example, we can rearrange "hello" by giving `l` and `h` a score of 1 and 2 respectively, and giving `e` and `o` a score of 11 and 10 (respectively). `e` will then appear at the front of the result as it received the highest score.

```
   'hello' \: 1 11 2 2 10
eollh
```

We can use this to sort our list of words, using the length of each word as its score.

```
   #&> ;: 'a tall cat'
1 4 3
   (;: 'a tall cat') \: 1 4 3
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇtall‚îÇcat‚îÇa‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îò
   (;: 'a tall cat') \: #&> ;: 'a tall cat'
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇtall‚îÇcat‚îÇa‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îò
```

## Making things shorter

We've successfully used the `;:`, `\:`, `#`, `&`, and `>` operators to piece together a working sort mechanism, but there's one flaw - we have to repeat `;: 'a tall cat'` twice üò±

To alleviate this, we can use one of J's strongest features, [hooks](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/primer/hook.htm).

In the following example, we'll take a list of numbers and add 7% to each of them. We may be inclined to write it like so:

```
   10 40 55 + 0.07&* 10 40 55
10.7 42.8 58.85
```

Which reads, take the list `10 40 55` and apply `0.07&*` (remember [bond](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/d630n.htm)?) to each item. Add the result to the list `10 40 55`.

(Author's note: we also may be inclined to just multiply by 1.07 but that requires math).

Hooks allow us to simplify this by simply leaving off one of the arguments.

```
   (+ 0.07&*) 10 40 55
10.7 42.8 58.85
```

How does this work? J recognizes that we have two verbs within our parentheses (`+` and `0.07&*`) and combines them into a "[hook](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/primer/hook.htm)." When we place a single argument at the end, J **automatically applies it to both sides of the hook**.

Put another way: `(f g) x <=> x f g x` for any two verbs `f` and `g` (don't forget your parentheses!)

So, the following expressions are equivalent:

```
   10 40 55 + 0.07&* 10 40 55
10.7 42.8 58.85
   (+ 0.07&*) 10 40 55
10.7 42.8 58.85
```

Let's circle back to our sorting mechanism before and see where we can apply this.

```
   (;: 'a tall cat') \: #&> ;: 'a tall cat'
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇtall‚îÇcat‚îÇa‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îò
```

Spot it? Between our two instances of `;: 'a tall cat'` we have two verbs: `\:` and `#&>`. Let's hook 'em.

```
   (\: #&>) ;: 'a tall cat'
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇtall‚îÇcat‚îÇa‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îò
```

Lastly, we can eliminate some whitespace and build our custom verb.

```
   sort =. \:#&>
   sort ;: 'a tall cat'
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇtall‚îÇcat‚îÇa‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îò
```

## We did it!

I hope this was a decently short and pleasant introduction into some fun features of the [J programming language](https://www.jsoftware.com/#/README):

- [`& Bond`](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/d630n.htm)
- [`\: Sort Down`](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/d432.htm)
- [Hooks](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/primer/hook.htm)

I encourage you to download J and play around with it. Hooks and forks and [other trains](https://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help804/dictionary/dictf.htm) pop up in all sorts of places and may make you think differently about the code you write everyday.

Thanks for reading ‚ú®
